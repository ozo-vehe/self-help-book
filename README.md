Whether it's relationship advice, career tips, or financial planning insights, this project is designed to be a supportive resource for your ongoing development.

Let's embark on this journey of self-discovery and improvement together! Feel free to make your first request and let the Self-Help Book guide you towards a more empowered and fulfilled life.

## Setup Instructions
Welcome to Self Help App! Follow these steps to set up your environment variables using a `.env` file for your React Native Expo app.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
https://github.com/hngx-org/self-help-book.git
cd your-project
```
### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Create `.env` File
Create a `.env` file in the root of your project. This file will store your sensitive information such as API keys, secrets, etc.
```plaintext
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_KEY="your_api_key"
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL='https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/text-davinci-002/completions'
```
> Replace `your_api_key` with an API Key gotten from the [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) official website after sign up or login.

### Step 4: Add `.env` to `.gitignore`
Add your `.env` file to your `.gitignore` to ensure that sensitive information is not committed to version control.
```plaintext
# .gitignore
.env
```

### Step 5: Running Your App

```bash
npx expo start
```

Your React Native Expo app should now be running with the environment variables configured from your `.env` file.

## Additional Notes
- Make sure to keep your `.env` file secure and do not share it publicly.
- If you make changes to your `.env` file, you might need to restart your development server for the changes to take effect.
- Consult the [React Native Environment Variables documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-variables) or [Environment variables in Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/environment-variables/) for more details.

Happy coding!
